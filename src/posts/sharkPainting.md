  The above image represents a painting I made during my freshman year of college. I attempted to copy the Jaws poster, though it didn't turn out as good as I hoped. But, this memory is dear to me because it represents good times with my friends from high school. It showed us that even though we were miles apart and didn't talk as often, we'd still always be close.
