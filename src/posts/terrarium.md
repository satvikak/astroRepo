  The above image represents a DIY terrarium I made at The Zone with my roommates. 
  Again, it isn't particularly artistic in its entirety, but it has a lot of beautiful components combined together. 
  Furthermore, this was such a great memory for me and my roommates, since we had such a great time just relaxing and making art together.
